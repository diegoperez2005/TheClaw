# 🛠️ The Claw – Touchless Robotic Arm Interface

> 🚧 Whoops! This page is currently **under construction** — I’m in the process of transferring and organizing everything. Stay tuned for updates!

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

**The Claw** is a real-time, touchless robotic arm control system. It uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to track hand gestures and translate them into precise movements of a robotic hand designed in **SolidWorks**. Additionally some of the goals of this project are too incorporate the software into a different project like a Robotic Dog, VTOL aircraft, or FPV Drone!

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- 🎯 **OpenCV** – Computer vision for real-time hand tracking  
- ✋ **MediaPipe** – High-fidelity gesture recognition  
- 🛠️ **SolidWorks** – CAD design and simulation of the robotic hand
